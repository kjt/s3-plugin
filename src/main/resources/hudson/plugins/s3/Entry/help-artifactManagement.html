    This lets Jenkins manage the artifacts, exactly like it does when the artifacts are published to the master.
    There are four options:
    <ul>
        <li><B>Unmanaged-flattened</B> stores the artifacts in the selected bucket,
            discarding the directory structure of the artifacts in the source project.</li>
        <li><B>Unmanaged-structured</B> stores the artifacts in the selected bucket
            while maintaining the directory structure.</li>
        <li><B>Managed-flattened</B> stores the artifacts in "jobs/[job]/[build-number]/" in the
            selected bucket, discarding the directory structure.</li>
        <li><B>Managed-structured</B> stores the artifacts in "jobs/[job]/[build-number]/" in the selected bucket
            while maintaining the directory structure.</li>
    </ul>

    When using one of the managed options, the following features are enabled:
    <ul>
        <li>artifacts are finger printed and linked to the build</li>
        <li>artifacts can be downloaded directly from the build page in the
            S3 Artifact section</li>
        <li>artifacts are automatically deleted when the build is deleted</li>
        <li>the <em>S3 Copy Artifact</em> build step can be used to download artifacts from S3
            automatically, helping build complex pipelines</li>
    </ul>
</div>
